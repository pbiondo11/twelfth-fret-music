          What started as a music school in Industry City, Brooklyn has turned into a lifestyle brand from coast to coast.
          Peter Biondo and Tarek Zantout grew up in the Bath Beach neighborhood in Brooklyn where their love of music, art, and creative expression drove them to start TFM to promote wellness, togetherness, and artistic expression—all through music.
          <br /><br />
          Twelfth Fret Music was built on the belief that music is more than sound—it's a force for community, healing, and cultural connection.
          From intimate jam sessions, to music gear and more, TFM creates spaces where people can show up as their authentic selves, collaborate freely, and create beautiful moments together.
          <br /><br />
          Whether through live events, purchases, or curated merch drops that reflect the heartbeat of Brooklyn, TFM has become a bridge between artists, listeners, and the journeys that bind them.
          With roots firmly planted in Brooklyn and a reach that now extends nationwide, two best friends continue to push the boundaries of what a music brand can be—one beat, one bond, one good feeling at a time.
